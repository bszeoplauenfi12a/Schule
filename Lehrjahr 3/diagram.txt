There are different possibilities to provide a big amount of data in a visual way. 
I would like to explain how a pie-diagram is constructed on the following example. 
The pie-diagram consists of a big circle, divided in different colors and a key where you can see the data.

This pie diagmram displays the spreading of operating systems, was published in March this year.
As you can see this graphics contain 4 colors that mean there are 4 different data sets which should be presented.
The different operating systems are marked as following, dark grey for Windows, bright grey for Macintosh,
purple for Linux and the very small white area for several other systems.
The chart shows that Windows is used for more than 90%, exactly 90,81%, of all systems distributed all over the world. 
The second one, rated on the count of systems, is Macintosh with 7,24%. That is normally installed on the 
Apple products. There is also a purple part of the circle which stands for Linux. It has a percentage about 1,61%.
To make the amount full to 100%, there is a remain of 0,34%. This are all other different operating systems.

As you can see at the graphic, the source of the diagram is web-stats.info. This is a service which provied
several diagrams, charts and graphics out of the IT business with actual data.
